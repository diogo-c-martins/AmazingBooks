# AmazingBooks
Google Maps API

Bugs to be fixed:
Glide won't load the thumbail image of book;
Navigation back to all books;

Additional features:
On detail view of a specific book initial implemented webview witch i later fixed by creating a new branch witch i added a layout to view the detailed book in a new branch;
In this new branch also added the buy link, but has a bug because some books don't have a buy link, witch passes the value 'null' this creates a fatal error in viewing the books saves to favorites.
